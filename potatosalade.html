<p>this Potato Salade contains super ingredient from Europ and are realy delicious for consumers</p>
<p><em>Charring the potatoes this way, the potatoes become earthy, sweet, and rich, and a careful choice of dressing and the other ingredients produces the most delicious version of potato salad ever<em></p>
	<p>I’ve cooked potatoes on top of the grill before making a salad with them, but I believe this is the first time they’ve actually been done directly on the coals. I love this technique, and as long as you can get past the appearance of almost completely charred potatoes, you will be enjoying a truly unique side dish. </p>
	<ul>Ingredients:

<li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
<li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
<li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
<h2> <b>Here are some steps followed to make Potato Salade at home</b></h2>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>

Nest potatoes directly in hot coals in a charcoal grill. Surround potatoes with coals for even roasting. Roast until charred, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn potatoes and continue to roast until deeply charred outside and tender inside, 6 to 7 minutes more.
	</li>

<li>
	

Remove potatoes to a bowl, cover with foil, and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight.

</li>
<li>
	

Combine Dijon mustard, cider vinegar, rice wine vinegar, vegetable oil, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl for the dressing and whisk thoroughly.

</li>
<li>
	
Scrape, peel, or cut off any fully charred surface of potato, leaving some dark brown bits for a deeper flavor. Cut potatoes into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch size pieces.s
